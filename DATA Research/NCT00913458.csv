NCT00913458,Study Evaluating Etanercept Plus Methotrexate in Early Rheumatoid Arthritis,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00913458,,COMPLETED,Study to evaluate whether there is sustained remission and productivity in subjects with early rheumatoid arthritis started on etanercept plus methotrexate treatment.,YES,"Active Rheumatoid Arthritis|Arthritis, Rheumatoid|Rheumatoid Arthritis",DRUG: etanercept,"Number of Participants That Met Sustained Remission at Week 76 and Week 91 Based on DAS28 Score, Sustained remission was defined as a DAS28 \<2.6 at the Week 76 and Week 91 visits without requiring a corticosteroid boost between the Week 52 and Week 64 visits, where the requirement for a corticosteroid boost was defined as a value of DAS28 \>3.2 at either the Week 56 or Week 64 visit.

DAS28 calculated from the number of swollen joints (SJC) and painful joints (PJC) using the 28 joints count, the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) (millimeters per hour \[mm/hour\]) and patient's global assessment (PGA) of disease activity.

The participants who met sustained remission in both Week 76 and 91 are presented here., 76 and 91 weeks","Number of Participants Achieving Complete Response (Using Disease Activity Score Based on 28-joint Count, Modified Total Sharp Score, Health Assessment Questionnaire), The composite measure of complete response over the last 3 months of Phase 1 was defined as:
