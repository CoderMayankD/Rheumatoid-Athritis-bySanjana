NCT04768413,Evaluation of a Non-face to Face Multidisciplinary Health Care Model in a Population With Rheumatoid Arthritis,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04768413,,UNKNOWN,"This research work proposes the evaluation of the implementation of a tele-orientation program and tele-consultation to the adult population with RA attended at a specialized rheumatology center in Bogota, Colombia, over a period of three months, by means of a observational, analytical, cohort, prospective study that will include mixed methods for collecting information (quantitative and qualitative)",NO,Rheumatoid Arthritis,OTHER: Teleconsultation either by phone or by computer consultation. Quantitative and qualitative approaches to analysis|OTHER: Care modalities. Quantitative and qualitative approaches to analysis,"Evaluation of the implementation of a non-face-to-face multidisciplinary consultation model in a population of rheumatoid arthritis, Evaluate the implementation of a non-face-to-face multidisciplinary consultation model in a population with rheumatoid arthritis, highly vulnerable to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 \[coronavirus disease (COVID-19)\] during a health emergency situation and evaluation of the effectiveness of their results., up to Week 12","Epidemiological characterization, Epidemiological characterization of the population evaluated under the multidisciplinary health care model, both in teleconsultation and face-to-face consultation., up to Week 12|Proportion of individuals infected, To determine the proportion of individuals infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 \[coronavirus disease (COVID-19)\] in those patients who regularly receive different immunosuppressive medications under the two care models (teleconsultation and face-to-face)., up to Week 12|Risk factors for infection, Describe the risk factors for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 \[coronavirus disease (COVID-19)\] infection in the group of patients linked to the teleconsultation model and in those with regular face-to-face care., up to Week 12|Risk factors for hospitalization, Describe the risk factors for hospitalization associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 \[coronavirus disease (COVID-19)\] in the group of patients linked to the teleconsultation model and in those with regular face-to-face care., up to Week 12|Risk factors for mortality, Describe the risk factors for mortality associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 \[coronavirus disease (COVID-19)\] in the group of patients linked to the teleconsultation model and in those with regular face-to-face care., up to Week 12|Average change from baseline in Disease Activity Score with 28-joint counts [DAS28] in face-to-face consultation group, A single score on a continuous scale (0-9.4). The level of disease activity will be interpreted as remission (DAS28 \<2.6), low (2.6 ≤ DAS28 \< 3.2), moderate (3.2 ≤DAS28≤ 5.1), or high (DAS28 \>5.1)., up to Week 12|Average change from baseline in Patient Activity Scale scores in both groups tele-assisted consultation and face-to-face consultation, The Patient Activity Scale is calculated by multiplying the Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) by 3.33 and then dividing the sum of the visual analogue scale (VAS) pain, Patient global assessment (PtGA), and Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) by 3. Activity will be interpreted as these categories of disease activity: remission ≤0.25, low ≤3.7, moderate \<8.0, and high ≥8.0., up to Week 12|Evaluation of participant's pain using visual analogue scale [VAS] in both groups tele-assisted consultation and face-to-face consultation, Paint measurement for any disease state 0-10 centimeters VAS by the patient, Baseline, Week 6 and 12|Evaluation of the disease activity by Doctor using visual analogue scale [VAS] in both groups tele-assisted consultation and face-to-face consultation, Activity measurement for any disease state 0-10 centimeters VAS by the Doctor, Baseline, Week 6 and 12|Absolute and percent change in the Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) in both groups tele-assisted consultation and face-to-face consultation, The questionary includes 20 daily life questions, grouped in 8 areas, each one containing two or three questions related to daily life activities. Each question is scored from 0-3. 0 means no disability, 3 score means completely disabled. The average of all responses is done. Average scores from 0-1 represent ""mild to moderate difficulty"", 1-2 means ""moderate to severe disability"", 3-2 indicates ""severe to very severe disability""., Baseline, Week 6 and 12|Average change from baseline in European Quality of Life 5 Dimensions (EQ-5D) questionnaire in both groups tele-assisted consultation and face-to-face consultation, European Quality of Life 5 Dimensions (EQ-5D) questionnaire is a self-reported health outcome which measures Quality of life (QoL) in five dimensions. An overall score is derived that measures from the least (worst) to the highest score (best). In addition, health state is measured on the vertical Visual Analogue scale (score 0 to 100) with higher scores (better health status)., up to Week 12|Evaluation of the level of therapeutic adherence using a specific Scale in both groups tele-assisted consultation and face-to-face consultation, The four item MORISKY-GREEN-LEVINE Medication Adherence Scale (MGLS) results in a score ranging from 0 to 4. There are three levels of medication adherence based on this score: high, medium and low adherence with 0, 1-2, and 3-4 points, respectively. A dichotomous definition of adherence based on MGLS will be used with 0 points indicating perfect adherence and 1+ points indicating some level of non-adherence., Baseline and week 12.|Evaluation of the self-care capacity using the Appraisal of Self-care Agency Scale -Revised (ASA-R) in both groups tele-assisted consultation and face-to-face consultation, The Appraisal of Self-care Agency Scale -Revised (ASA-R; Sousa et al.) is one of the main instruments to assess self-care capacity. It consists of a total of 15 questions in 3 areas, of which the area lacking self-care agency is reversely coded. Based on a 5-point Likert scale, a higher total score signified a higher level of self-care agency., Baseline and week 12.","Description of individual experiences of patients: Qualitative data analysis, A semi-directed interview will be undertaken with patients with rheumatoid arthritis. The aim will be to obtain a description of their experiences concerning how their health care was developed during the pandemic time and how health-related decisions are made individually considering the interactions with health care professionals in both models face to face and teleconsultation., The moment of the interview (week 12)|Description of individual experiences of health care professionals: Qualitative data analysis, Health care professionals will also be interviewed regarding their experiences and needs in rheumatoid arthritis attention based on the two models, in the shared decision-making process and in establishing objective medical decisions., The moment of the interview (week 12)",Fundación Universitaria de Ciencias de la Salud,Biomab I.P.S.
