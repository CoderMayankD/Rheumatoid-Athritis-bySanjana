Primary Outcome Measures,Secondary Outcome Measures
"Changes from Baseline in Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI) Score, To evaluate the effect of the use of Nitazoxanide and Escitalopram as an add-on therapy in patients with rheumatoid arthritis by evaluating the change from baseline in the clinical findings as measured by Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI) scores. A lower CDAI score from Baseline would mean improvement in disease activity and an increase in CDAI score from Baseline would mean an increase in disease activity or a worsening in disease activity. Scores: 0.0-2.8 = Range for Remission; 2.9-10.0 = Range for Low disease activity; 10.1-22.0 Range for Moderate disease activity; 22.1-76 Range for High disease activity. Total range is from 0-100, with the high scores representing high disease activity., Baseline, 12 weeks|Changes in Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rates (ESR), Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rates (ESR) values will be made at baseline and after 12 weeks to determine the number of patients whose test result improved or worsened. ESR (normal range 0-28 mm/hr). If the value is increased, the disease activity worsened. If the value is reduced the disease activity is improved., Baseline, 12 weeks|Changes in C- reactive Protein (CRP), C- reactive Protein (CRP) values will be made at baseline and after 12 weeks to determine the number of patients whose test result improved or worsened. CRP value (normal range \<1.0 mg/dl). If the value is increased, the disease activity worsened. If the value is reduced the disease activity is improved., Baseline,12 weeks|Changes in Rheumatoid factor (RF) values, Rheumatoid factor (RF) values will be made at baseline and after 12 weeks to determine the number of patients whose test result improved or worsened. If the value is increased, the disease activity worsened. If the value is reduced the disease activity is improved., Baseline,12 weeks|Changes in Anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (Anti-CCP) values, Anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (Anti-CCP) values will be made at baseline and after 12 weeks to determine the number of patients whose test result improved or worsened. If the value is increased, the disease activity worsened. If the value is reduced the disease activity is improved., Baseline,12 weeks","Determination of Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) levels, Serum STAT3 levels will be measured by means of the human enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) technique according to the manufacturers protocol, Baseline,12 weeks|Determination of Toll-like receptor4 (TLR-4) levels, Serum TLR4 levels will be measured by means of the human enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) technique according to the manufacturers protocol., Baseline,12 weeks|Determination of interleukin-1β (IL-1β) levels, Serum IL-1β levels will be measured by means of the human enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) technique according to the manufacturers protocol., Baseline, 12 weeks|Determination of Malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, Serum MDA levels will be measured by means of the human enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) technique according to the manufacturers protocol, Baseline, 12 weeks"
