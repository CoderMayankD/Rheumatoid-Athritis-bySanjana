"biomarkers:Gene products that are affected by disease-specific pathomechanisms or treatment, serving as indicators of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) severity and progression.","Gene products as biomarkers, which are affected by disease-specific pathomechanisms or by treatment, are of diagnostic importance. Many genes found differentially expressed in tissues are elevated as part of the infiltration, while only a smaller fraction becomes regulated upon inflammation.

"IL-6:Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is another clinical biomarker associated with rheumatoid arthritis, reflecting the inflammatory processes involved in the disease and serving as an indicator of disease progression.","Rheumatoid arthritis(RA) is a representative autoimmune disease characterized by systemic, chronic, destructive inflammatory synovitis and multiple organ manifestations, resulting in severe disability and mortality rates. The accumulation of inflammatory cells, the self-perpetuation of inflammation and induction and/or activation of osteoclasts lead to cartilage and bone destruction and multiple organ manifestations.
