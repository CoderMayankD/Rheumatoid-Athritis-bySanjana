This concept forms part of the mucosal origins hypothesis, which posits that autoimmune processes may begin at mucosal sites like the lungs and contribute to the systemic development of RA. The key findings from these investigations point to specific inflammatory and immune abnormalities in the lungs of people who are at risk of RA.

1. Pulmonary Inflammation and Autoantibodies in At-Risk Individuals

One major discovery is that a substantial subset of individuals at-risk of RA—meaning people who have not yet developed full-blown RA but have certain risk factors—show signs of airway inflammation. Imaging studies have revealed that 76% of at-risk individuals have inflammatory abnormalities in their airways, compared to just 33% in healthy controls (with statistical significance, P < 0.01). This indicates that lung inflammation is much more common in those predisposed to developing RA, even before joint symptoms emerge.
In addition to inflammation, 20–35% of these at-risk individuals show local production of RA-related autoantibodiesin the lungs, particularly in their sputum (mucus expelled from the lungs). These autoantibodies include anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPAs) and rheumatoid factor (RF), which are critical markers for RA and can appear long before joint damage occurs. The presence of these autoantibodies in the lungs suggests that the immune system is becoming activated in the lung tissue itself, possibly triggering a broader autoimmune response.

2. Neutrophil Extracellular Traps (NETs) and Citrullinated Proteins

Another key finding is that neutrophils, a type of immune cell, isolated from the sputum of both at-risk individuals and patients with clinical RA, show a heightened tendency to form neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). NETs are networks of DNA and proteins released by neutrophils in response to infection or inflammation. In RA, these NETs are problematic because they contain citrullinated proteins, which are proteins altered by the enzyme peptidylarginine deiminase (PAD), making them targets for the immune system. This process correlates with the increased levels of ACPA in the sputum, meaning that NET formation in the lungs might be a key early step in the autoimmune cascade leading to RA.

6. Potential Mechanisms
The underlying mechanisms driving these lung endotypes (patterns of inflammation and immune dysfunction in the lungs) remain uncertain, but they likely involve a mix of:
	•	Environmental factors: Smoking, pollution, or other inhaled irritants can promote lung inflammation.
	•	Microbial dysbiosis: Changes in the lung microbiome may trigger or sustain immune responses.
	•	Genetic predispositions: Individuals with certain genetic markers, such as the HLA-DRB1 shared epitope, may be more susceptible to developing lung-associated autoimmunity.
	•	Immune responses: Expansion of immune cells that react to citrullinated proteins and peptides might drive the generation of systemic autoantibodies.
The concept of mucosal endotypes in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) suggests that immune dysregulation originating at mucosal sites—such as the lungs, gut, and oral cavity—can trigger systemic immune abnormalities long before clinical symptoms of RA appear. This section explores the systemic immune changes seen in individuals at risk of RA, emphasizing how early immune responses, including the production of autoantibodies and changes in immune cell populations, evolve towards a more pathogenic state as RA develops. These findings further support the mucosal origins hypothesis, which posits that inflammation and immune dysregulation at mucosal sites are closely tied to the systemic immune changes that lead to RA.
1. Presence of Circulating Autoantibodies in At-Risk Individuals
One key finding is that autoantibodies, such as anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPAs), rheumatoid factor (RF), and anti-modified protein antibodies (AMPAs), are present in the bloodstream of individuals at risk for RA, even before they show clinical symptoms. These autoantibodies can be detected in several large populations of healthy individuals who have not yet developed RA, such as blood donors, military personnel (through the Department of Defense Serum Repository), and participants in long-term studies like the Nurses Health Study. This indicates that the autoimmune process begins well before the clinical onset of RA, possibly triggered by immune activation at mucosal sites. These autoantibodies are found across various populations and ethnic backgrounds, reinforcing the idea that mucosal immune activation is a widespread and early event in RA pathogenesis.
2. Evolving Pathogenicity of Autoantibodies
As individuals progress toward clinical RA, the effector functions and glycosylation patterns of these circulating autoantibodies become more pathogenic. Glycosylation refers to the addition of sugar molecules to antibodies, which can alter their ability to trigger immune responses. In pre-RA, these antibodies evolve to have more inflammatory properties, which increases their capacity to bind and attack citrullinated proteins. This heightened activity suggests that early autoimmune events occurring at mucosal sites contribute to a shift in systemic autoantibody behavior, making them more harmful over time.
3. T Cell and Monocyte Abnormalities
Beyond autoantibodies, significant changes in immune cell populations occur in individuals at risk of RA. For example, T cells, a type of immune cell responsible for coordinating immune responses, show alterations in their subsets:
	•	CD4+ T cells with a hypo-glycolytic and hyperproliferative phenotype have been identified in pre-RA individuals. These T cells have altered metabolism, which leads to an increased rate of proliferation and immune activity.
	•	These changes in T cell function are also linked to the PTPN22 gene, which encodes a phosphatase that regulates immune responses. Mutations or altered activity of PTPN22 in at-risk individuals contribute to an overactive immune system, increasing susceptibility to autoimmune conditions like RA.
Additionally, monocytes (another type of immune cell) in individuals at risk of RA show enhanced activity. Specifically, CD14hi monocytes demonstrate:
	•	Increased histone H3 citrullination, which is a chemical modification of proteins involved in packaging DNA. This citrullination process, driven by the enzyme peptidylarginine deiminase 4 (PAD4), leads to the production of citrullinated proteins that become targets for the immune system.
	•	These monocytes also produce more pro-inflammatory cytokines in response to Toll-like receptor (TLR) stimulation. TLRs are part of the innate immune system and recognize microbial invaders or damaged cells, suggesting that monocyte activation could be driven by inflammation at mucosal sites, such as the lungs or gut.
4. Epigenetic Changes in B and T Cells
Immune dysregulation in at-risk individuals also involves epigenetic changes in B cells and T cells. Epigenetics refers to modifications to DNA that affect gene expression without altering the genetic code itself. In individuals at risk of RA:
	•	Naive and memory T cells exhibit epigenetic changes that affect T cell receptor and interferon receptor signaling. These changes may alter how the immune system responds to infections or other immune triggers, making it more prone to autoimmune responses.
	•	These epigenetic modifications are believed to set the stage for more significant immune abnormalities as individuals progress from pre-RA to clinical RA.
5. T Cells Reacting to Citrullinated Proteins
A critical aspect of the immune dysregulation in at-risk individuals is the identification of T cells that specifically recognize citrullinated peptides, particularly from cartilage proteins like citrullinated cartilage intermediate layer protein I (cit-CILP). These T cells, which are part of the body’s adaptive immune system, exhibit various immune responses, including TH1 and TH17 phenotypes, which are associated with inflammation. Additionally, T stem cell memory (TSCM)-like phenotypes are found in these cells, suggesting that these T cells retain a long-term memory of their encounter with citrullinated proteins, potentially fueling chronic autoimmune responses.
Other citrullinated proteins recognized by these immune cells include:
	•	Citrullinated clusterin (cit-clusterin)
	•	Citrullinated fibrinogen (cit-fibrinogen)
	•	Citrullinated histone H4 (cit-histone H4)
The recognition of these citrullinated proteins by immune cells in pre-RA individuals strongly suggests that the autoimmune process begins long before joint inflammation becomes apparent, with mucosal sites likely playing a key role in presenting these proteins to the immune system.
6. Link Between Mucosal Inflammation and Systemic Immune Changes
All of these immune abnormalities—autoantibody production, T cell dysregulation, monocyte activation, and epigenetic changes—are thought to reflect ongoing local mucosal inflammation. The exact relationship between the site-specific mucosal alterations (in the lungs, gut, or oral cavity) and these systemic immune phenotypes is not fully understood. However, the evidence suggests that inflammation at mucosal sites might drive the systemic immune dysregulation seen in pre-RA, ultimately leading to the development of full RA.
The challenge moving forward is to clarify how these mucosal endotypes (distinct inflammatory pathways at different mucosal sites) interact with the systemic immune system to promote RA. Researchers aim to use systems biology approaches to integrate data from different levels of biology (genomics, proteomics, and immune responses) to better understand these interactions and potentially identify new ways to prevent or treat RA at its earliest stages.
Conclusion
In summary, the immune dysregulation seen in individuals at risk of RA involves the early production of autoantibodies, changes in T cell and monocyte function, and epigenetic alterations, all of which may be driven by mucosal inflammation. The presence of these early immune changes supports the hypothesis that mucosal sites play a crucial role in the initial stages of RA, even before clinical symptoms arise. Further research is needed to understand how local mucosal processes relate to systemic immunity and how this knowledge can be used to prevent RA.
