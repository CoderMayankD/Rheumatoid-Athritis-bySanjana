AB  - OBJECTIVES: In this study, we attempt to explore the feasibility of alternative 
      dosing regimens of etanercept in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) using 
      pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) modeling and simulation. METHODS: All 
      data used for estimation of PK/PD model parameters were collected from previously 
      published literatures. American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 20/50/70 response 
      rate and a disease activity score in 28 joints (DAS28) was selected as the 
      principal clinical endpoint for further PK/PD modeling. The cumulative AUC (area 
      under the concentration-time curve) of etanercept for different dosing regimens 
      was calculated based on the final PK model and was then linked to the time course 
      of clinical endpoints. Ten different dosing regimens were simulated in this 
      study. RESULTS: The PK model that best fit the serum concentration-time data for 
      etanercept was a one-compartment model with first order absorption and 
      elimination. Based on the PK/PD analysis, the relationship between the predicted 
      cumulative AUC of etanercept to the ACR 20/50/70 response rate and DAS28 score 
      was well characterized by Emax logistic and inhibitory Emax model, respectively. 
      In our simulations, the following dosing regimens that are equally effective to 
      current recommended dosage of 25 mg twice weekly (b.i.w.): (1) 25 mg once weekly 
      (q.w.); (2) 50 mg every 2 weeks (q2w); (3) 25 mg b.i.w. for 3 months and 25 mg 
      q2w thereafter; and (4) 50 mg q.w. for 3 months and 50 mg q2w thereafter. 
      CONCLUSION: In this study, the clinical data was well described by the models 
      developed, and several alternative dosing regimens were proposed. Further 
      clinical studies in patients are still needed to confirm our findings.
