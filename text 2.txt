The term "endotype" refers to distinct disease subtypes defined by unique biological pathways or mechanisms.

According to this hypothesis, individuals at risk of RA may have specific endotypes based on the primary mucosal site involved. For example, one person might develop RA due to immune disturbances originating in the lungs (lung-associated endotype), while another person might have a gut-associated endotype, and still another might have a mixed endotype involving both lung and oral (periodontal) pathways. 
￼

hypothesis explanation focuses on how specific immune disturbances originating at different mucosal sites—like the lungs, gut, and mouth—can initiate RA. The hypothesis argues that immune system dysfunction may start at these mucosal surfaces, driven by a combination of factors such as genetics, microbial imbalances (dysbiosis), environmental exposures (like smoking), and the body's own immune responses. Each mucosal site might have a different "endotype" or subtype of RA, defined by the particular pathways that cause the disease to emerge from that location.

For example, in someone with a lung-associated endotype, the immune dysfunction may begin in the lung mucosa, possibly triggered by smoking, respiratory infections, or environmental pollutants. This immune disturbance could result in the production of autoantibodies—proteins that mistakenly attack the body’s own tissues—specifically at the lung’s mucosal surface. Over time, this localized immune reaction in the lungs spreads through the bloodstream, eventually reaching the joints, where it causes inflammation and leads to RA.

On the other hand, a person with a gut-associated endotype might have an imbalance in their gut microbiota, or the bacteria that naturally reside in the intestines. This microbial imbalance could trigger an immune response in the gut, leading to the production of similar autoantibodies. Again, these antibodies can travel through the bloodstream and trigger systemic inflammation, including in the joints, resulting in clinical RA.
In some cases, individuals might have a mixed endotype, where immune disturbances occur in multiple mucosal sites simultaneously—such as both the lungs and the mouth (periodontal tissues)—leading to a combination of these mechanisms contributing to the onset of RA.
These immune disturbances don’t remain confined to the mucosal surfaces. They spread throughout the body, triggering a systemic autoimmune process that results in joint inflammation, which is a hallmark of RA. The production of autoantibodies, such as rheumatoid factor and anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPAs), is an essential part of this systemic spread. These autoantibodies can attack joint tissues, causing inflammation and eventually leading to the chronic joint damage seen in clinical RA.
The hypothesis also suggests that the specific mucosal endotype an individual has might continue to play a role even after the disease progresses to the joint-inflammation stage. This means that the mechanisms that began at the mucosal sites (lungs, gut, or mouth) might still influence how the disease behaves and how a person responds to treatment. Understanding these endotypes could help doctors develop more personalized approaches to treating RA, as different endotypes might respond better to different therapies.
In summary, this hypothesis broadens our understanding of RA by suggesting that the disease doesn't always start in the joints. Instead, it could begin in the mucosal surfaces of the lungs, gut, or mouth, with these localized immune disturbances eventually spreading and evolving into the systemic autoimmunity that leads to RA. This insight could pave the way for new treatment strategies, especially if the disease can be caught and treated early during its "pre-RA" phase, before joint damage occurs.
Users also ask these questions:
	1.	What are the most common autoantibodies involved in rheumatoid arthritis?
	2.	How do environmental factors like smoking influence the development of RA?
	3.	What is the role of the lung mucosa in the onset of rheumatoid arthritis?

	1.	Smoking increases the permeability of the lung's epithelial barriers.

	2.	This allows immune cells and autoantibodies to enter the bloodstream more easily, spreading the inflammatory process throughout the body. Over time, this systemic inflammation can manifest in the joints, leading to the development of clinical RA.
1. Smoking-Induced Immune Response and Autoantibody Production
When the lung's epithelial cells are exposed to cigarette smoke, they become inflamed and release pro-inflammatory cytokines like tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin-6 (IL-6). These cytokines recruit immune cells such as macrophages and neutrophils to the site of inflammation, intensifying the immune response. As this inflammation persists, proteins within the lung tissue undergo a process known as citrullination, where the enzyme peptidylarginine deiminase (PAD) converts the amino acid arginine in proteins into citrulline. Normally, citrullinated proteins are harmless, but in the context of RA, the immune system begins to mistakenly identify them as foreign invaders.
This immune misrecognition leads to the production of anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPAs). ACPAs target citrullinated proteins and are strongly associated with RA. Smoking accelerates this process by increasing both citrullination and the immune system’s exposure to these altered proteins. This is particularly significant in individuals who carry the HLA-DRB1 shared epitope—a genetic marker associated with RA susceptibility. The HLA-DRB1 allele encodes a part of the immune system’s major histocompatibility complex (MHC), which is involved in presenting antigens (such as citrullinated proteins) to immune cells. In people with the shared epitope, the MHC more efficiently presents citrullinated proteins to T cells, amplifying the immune response and leading to the production of ACPAs.
2. Systemic Immune Spread from the Lungs
The immune activation in the lungs does not remain localized. Smoking increases the permeability of the lung’s epithelial barrier, allowing immune cells and inflammatory molecules to enter the bloodstream. This promotes a systemic immune response, where ACPAs and other autoantibodies circulate throughout the body. Once these autoantibodies reach the joints, they bind to citrullinated proteins in the synovium (the lining of the joints), causing synovitis and eventually leading to chronic joint inflammation—a hallmark of RA. Over time, this chronic inflammation results in the destruction of joint tissues, cartilage, and bone.
3. Microbial Dysbiosis and Its Role at the Genetic Level
In addition to smoking, microbial imbalances (dysbiosis) at mucosal surfaces—particularly in the lungs, gut, and mouth—play a critical role in RA development. The lungs and gut are lined with a complex community of microorganisms, known as the microbiome, that maintain immune balance. Smoking disrupts this microbial ecosystem, leading to dysbiosis. For example, it can alter the lung microbiome by promoting the growth of pathogenic bacteria and reducing the diversity of protective microbial species. This microbial imbalance triggers further immune activation.
The gut microbiome also plays a significant role in RA pathogenesis. Smoking and other environmental factors can disturb the balance between beneficial and harmful microbes in the gut. Dysbiosis leads to a leaky gut, where the gut barrier becomes more permeable, allowing microbial byproducts such as lipopolysaccharides (LPS) to enter the bloodstream. LPS is a potent immune activator, promoting systemic inflammation and further enhancing the production of ACPAs.
At the genetic level, the presence of RA-associated genes—like those encoding HLA-DRB1—influences how the immune system responds to microbial antigens. In genetically susceptible individuals, dysbiosis can cause the immune system to overreact to harmless or beneficial microbes, treating them as threats and initiating an autoimmune response. For instance, specific bacteria in the gut, like Prevotella copri, have been found to be more prevalent in individuals with early RA. This bacterium may promote inflammation and contribute to the generation of autoantibodies, particularly in people with genetic predispositions to RA.
4. Oral Microbiome and Periodontal Disease
Another key mucosal site is the oral cavity. Periodontal disease, caused by bacterial infections such as Porphyromonas gingivalis, is strongly associated with RA. This bacterium is unique because it produces an enzyme that directly increases the citrullination of proteins in the gums, amplifying the immune response and ACPA production. Smoking worsens periodontal disease, further enhancing citrullination and promoting the spread of autoantibodies from the mouth to the joints. Genetic susceptibility also plays a role here, as individuals with the shared epitope are more likely to develop aggressive forms of both periodontal disease and RA due to their heightened immune response to citrullinated proteins.
5. Interaction Between Environmental and Genetic Factors
In summary, smoking serves as a key environmental trigger that interacts with genetic factors, like the HLA-DRB1shared epitope, to induce an abnormal immune response. This immune response is initially localized at mucosal sites such as the lungs, but through mechanisms like citrullination and microbial dysbiosis, it spreads systemically, leading to autoantibody production and ultimately joint inflammation. Smoking not only increases citrullination but also alters the microbial balance in mucosal surfaces like the lungs, gut, and mouth, further promoting systemic autoimmunity. In genetically susceptible individuals, these environmental triggers cause the immune system to overreact, resulting in the generation of ACPAs and the eventual development of RA.
By influencing both immune and microbial dynamics, smoking and dysbiosis illustrate how environmental and genetic factors combine to drive the onset and progression of RA. Understanding these interactions helps explain why smoking is such a potent risk factor for RA and highlights the importance of addressing both immune and microbial health in the prevention and treatment of the disease.
